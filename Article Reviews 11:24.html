Partners Daniela Della Rosa and Federico Criscuoli have written an article discussing new 'virtual try-on' AI technologies and their impact on the luxury fashion industry. 
Read the full article below. 
1. WHAT ARE VIRTUAL TRY-ON TECHNOLOGIES AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
AI technologies are slowly disrupting several industries, and luxury, especially fashion, is no exception to this trend.
One of the most interesting AI applications in this regard is the so-called “Virtual Try-On” technology, which leverages augmented reality (AR) to allow customers to digitally try on clothing, accessories, and other fashion items, without the need of physically visiting a store of the brand. 
Herein below how it works. 
o First, the customers provide their measurements either directly or through a 3D body scanning tool made available by the brand (via website or app).
o The measurements allow the AI to immediately create a digital avatar of the customer’s body, which is more accurate than a 3D body scan.
o Brands have created a digital copy of their clothing or eyeglasses or bag or watch or other fashion item, reproducing in 3D their design, color, fabric texture, etc., that can then be used on the digital body avatar.
o Customers can experience virtual try-ons through AR applications, which can be downloaded on smartphones or tablets or pc browsers, but also on virtual reality headsets, on any of these devices. The same technology overlays the digital fashion items onto the customer's real-world image (through their digital body avatar).
o The customer can then interact in real time, more or less depending on the specific application in use, like adjusting the fit or zooming in or customizing colors, styles, sizes, etc. 
This technology appears especially promising as a means to make shopping more conscious and sustainable. For example, a luxury brand may choose to use virtual try-ons to enhance its clients’ shopping experience, reducing the return rate of fashion items, increasing customer engagement, data collection, differentiating from competition, and cross-selling items suggested on the basis of the chosen virtual outfit.
2. EXAMPLE OF BRANDS’ VIRTUAL TRY-ON USE
Several multi-brands resellers and fashion houses have joined the fray to offer similar services.
Below are just a few examples of virtual try-on, mostly through dedicated apps or their own store website:
o Chanel, makeup;
o Burberry, eyeglasses;
o Gucci, sneakers and accessories;
o Prada, sunglasses;
o Chrono24 (multi-brand), watches;
o PerfectCorp (AR software provider), watches.
Even Amazon currently offers a slightly different kind of AR implementation, dedicated to furniture and home décor. This AR shopping tool allows consumers, through a smartphone or tablet, to visualize an item of their choosing (like a table or vase) within their room, sized and rendered to scale, having a preview of one or more products before buying.
3. LEGAL CHALLENGES
Virtual try-on technologies open many interesting possibilities for luxury and fashion brands, however they also brings about a host of potential legal challenges that industry stakeholders should address to gain the most from this innovation. The recently approved European AI Act will require compliance from AI technologies providers, including, possibly, virtual try-on technology.
Here are some of the challenges relevant for the most innovative stakeholders:
3.1. Data Privacy and Security 
Customers’ data, especially biometric measurements and facial recognition, are essential for virtual try-on technologies to work as intended.
Collecting, storing, and processing such sensitive information raise significant privacy and security concerns. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) apply to the mentioned activities, and brands should carefully evaluate compliance when dealing with the digitalization of the customer body as described above. Consent collection, specific DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment), data minimization, are only some of the actions to be taken in such context.
There are also several data protection technological measures that can be implemented, like data encryption, anonymization, and secure/cold storage.
The above may also be relevant for technology providers in relation to compliance undertakings under the European Digital Services Act.
3.2. Liability and Consumers’ protection
The opportunity to visualize how a product will appear on customers before they make a purchase is welcome, however should the virtual representation significantly differ from the actual product received, or be so perceived, customers’ dissatisfaction may bring them to claim liability from seller.
